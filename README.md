# Sorting Visualizer
This project is a visualizer employing the use of Recharts through React to visualize popular sorting algorithms to deepen understanding of these algorithms in a tangible manner as opposed to purely conceptual through code.

# User Guide

# Planned Additions
* Add more sorting algorithms!
* Add colours to visualizer to further demonstrate the algorithms.
* Implement something similar to the Sound of Sorting (https://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/) that plays sounds of varying pitch based on the value of the array entries.
